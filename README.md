Welcome to the official repository for the [AI Conference Deadlines website](https://aideadlines.nauen-it.de)! This is a community-driven project dedicated to providing a clean, simple, and up-to-date list of deadlines for major AI, Machine Learning, and related conferences.

---

### üôè We Need Your Help

This project thrives on community contributions. The world of academic conferences is always changing, and it's tough for one person to keep up.

If you notice a conference is missing, a deadline is incorrect, or you have more accurate information for an estimated date, **you have the power to fix it!** Your contribution will help thousands of researchers and students around the world.

## How to Contribute

Contributing is simple! All the conference data is stored in human-readable `.yaml` files. You don't need to be a programmer to help out.

### Find or Create the Conference File

All conference data is located in the `conferences/` directory.

- **To update an existing conference series:** Find the corresponding file (e.g., for AAAI, open `aaai.yaml`).
- **To add a new conference series:** Create a new file named after the conference's common acronym (e.g., `emnlp.yaml`).

### Add or Edit the Conference Data

Inside the file, you can either edit an existing entry or add a new one for a future year. Each conference year is a separate entry, starting with a unique key (like `aaai2025:`).

Here is an example entry for a single conference:

```yaml
aaai2025:
  conferenceEndDate: "2025-03-04"
  conferenceStartDate: "2025-02-25"
  dataSrc: manual
  id: aaai2025
  isApproximateDeadline: false
  location: Pennsylvania Convention Center, Philadelphia, USA
  shortname: AAAI 2025
  tags:
    - DM
    - ML
    - NLP
    - CV
  timeline:
    - abstractDeadline: "2024-08-08T11:59:59Z"
      deadline: "2024-08-16T11:59:59Z"
  timezone: UTC-12 # The original timezone of the deadline, e.g., "AoE" which is UTC-12
  title: AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence
  website: https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/
```

### Understanding the Data Fields

When adding or editing a conference, please refer to the table below.
Date formats are flexible and will be automatically converted to `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` by the `dateparser` package.
